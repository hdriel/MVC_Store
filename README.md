# MVC product Store 

### C# , MCV, EntityFramework, SQL Server (SSMS2012)

## Description


In this project, I built a product store, where customers sign up for the site, and can search for products, buy / cancel purchases, and the manager of the site can edit products: add / update / delete,
<br><br>

In this project, the main thing was to program in C # according to MVC, when the server is a local server in the SQL Server Managment System 2012, when the information through it through EntityFramework.
<br><br>

I did not focus on this project on the design of the site, but only on its programming principles ..
<br><br>
I put a detailed guide on how to run the project
